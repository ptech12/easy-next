# Hello ğŸ‘‹ I'm A Next13 TypeScript Template!

created by [Li Yuxuan](https://xmliszt.github.io)

## Introduction

A few things to take notes before you start:

- This is a TypeScript template. JavaScript is currently not supported.
- The template will install the latest **NextJS** version (Next13), with the "App Router" mode enabled. If you are more familiar with the traditional "Pages Router", feel free to change the example application. (For more details about "App Router" vs "Pages Router", visit [NextJS Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) to find out more!)
- The template will also by-default install the following packages. Feel free to modify or remove any of them if you don't want to include them in your project. **I will publish another version in the future, which will make these optional instead!**
  - TailwindCSS
  - Chakra UI
  - ESLint

## How to use

- simply run `npx create-easy-next13-template-ts@latest` and follow on screen instructions!

```bash
npx create-easy-next13-template-ts@latest
```
