## Getting Started

A few things to take notes before you start:

- This is a TypeScript template. JavaScript is currently not supported.
- The template will install the latest **NextJS** version (Next13), with the "**App Router**" mode enabled. If you are more familiar with the traditional "Pages Router", feel free to change the example application. (For more details about "App Router" vs "Pages Router", visit [NextJS Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) to find out more!)
- The template will also by default include the followings. Feel free to modify or remove any of them if you don't want to include them in your project. **Instructions on how to remove them are documented at the end of this README.**
  - Install TailwindCSS
  - Install ESLint
  - Set up PWA
  - Set up SEO

## Installation

- simply run `npx easy-next@latest` and follow on screen instructions!

```bash
npx easy-next@latest
```

## Remove Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

The project is automatically configured with sample SEO approach. You can find the details in `app/layout.tsx`, where you see the `export const metadata: Metadata = {...}` is being defined. If you wish to remove SEO, simply remove the entire metadata block. For more information about metadata in Next13, check out: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata

## Remove Progressive Web App (PWA)

The project is by default bootstrapped with PWA using `next-pwa`. If you wish to remove PWA, you can follow the below steps:

1. Go to `next.config.js` in root directory, remove anything related to PWA, namely `withPWA` and change `module.exports = withPWA(nextConfig);` into `module.exports = nextConfig;`
2. Go to `public/` and remove `manifest.json`
3. Go to `app/layout.tsx`, (assuming you have SEO enabled), in the `metadata` block, remove `manifest`, `appleWebApp` fields.

## Remove ESLint

The project is by default installed with ESLint. If you wish to remove it, simply remove the `.eslintrc.json` in root directory. You can also remove the `lint` field in the `scripts` field in `package.json`.

## Remove TailwindCSS

The project is by default installed with TailwindCSS integration with Next13. If you wish to remove it, follow the below steps:

1. At root directory, remove `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`
2. In `app/globals.css`, remove the `@tailwind` lines at the top, and any lines that start with `@apply`

> Note: once you remove tailwindCSS, all the tailwindCSS syntax in `className` will not work anymore! You have to remove them or create your own CSS classes.
